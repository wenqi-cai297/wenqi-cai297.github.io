<p>I am currently an M.Sc. student at the University of Toyama, with a research focus on computer vision and deep learning.<p>
<p>I come from Nanchang, Jiangxi, China. Now I’m living in Toyama, Japan, and actively learning Japanese. I’d be happy to make new friends here!<p>
<p>Outside of my studies, I’m passionate about gaming,especially challenging genres like soul-like, rogue-like, and star-hunting games, while also enjoying more relaxing ones such as Terraria, Dyson Sphere Program, and Slay the Spire. Beyond gaming and research, I love spending time outdoors with friends—whether it’s walking, hiking, or exploring nature. I also enjoy listening to music in my free time.<p>
